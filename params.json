{"name":"Photon-HDF5 Converter","tagline":"Online service to convert files to Photon-HDF5.","body":"# Photon-HDF5 Online Converter\r\n\r\nThis is a demo service to convert data files to [Photon-HDF5](http://www.photon-hdf5.org) \r\nwithout the need to install any software. Currently, input data files \r\ncannot be larger than 35 MB.\r\n\r\nThe supported file formats are PicoQuant **HT3** (ns-ALEX or PIE), \r\nBecker & Hickl **SPC/SET** (ns-ALEX or PIE) and \r\nthe Î¼s-ALEX format **SM** (a format formerly used in Weiss Lab).\r\nFor each supported file format we provide a Jupyter notebook that\r\ncontains both the instructions and the code to convert the file.\r\n\r\nTo launch the demo click on the following button:\r\n\r\n[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/Photon-HDF5/Photon-HDF5-Converter)\r\n\r\nFor instructions on *how to use the notebook interface* see [this page](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb#The-Notebook-dashboard). For an overview of what *Jypyter Notebook* is refer to this\r\n[nature paper](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261),\r\nand to the [Jupyter Project Homepage](https://jupyter.org/).\r\n\r\n# Install the converter locally\r\n\r\nUnder the hood this demo service runs the phconvert software.\r\nYou can install phconvert on you own desktop following the\r\ninstructions in the [phconvert homepage](http://photon-hdf5.github.io/phconvert/).\r\n\r\n# Feedback\r\n\r\nFor questions or comments please:\r\n\r\n- [Open an GitHub issue](https://github.com/Photon-HDF5/phconvert/issues) or\r\n- Ask a question on the [Photon-HDF5 Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/photon-hdf5).\r\n\r\n# How this demo was built?\r\n\r\nThis online demo uses [MyBinder.org](http://mybinder.org/) to run the\r\nJupyter notebooks included with [phconvert](http://photon-hdf5.github.io/phconvert/). \r\nMany thanks to [Jeremy Freeman](http://www.jeremyfreeman.net/) \r\nand collaborators for providing this amazing service.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
